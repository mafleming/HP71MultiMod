HP71MultiMod Repository

# A ROM Emulator Board for the HP-71B
**23-October-2021**
Source files for the MultiMod board bootloader. These files
are compiled, linked, and loaded with XC8 v2.32 in MicroChip MPLAB X IDE v5.45.
MPLAB X and XC8 can be obtained from Microchip.com in their development tools repository.

This bootloader was generated by the MCC tool and is a C implementation of the
AN851 bootloader. The bootloader protocol is simpler than that of the AN1310
bootloader used with the original MPASM-based version of the MultiMod code in
the src directory.

# Build Instructions
First create a standalone application project with the suggested name of
BootLoaderK40. Copy the main.c file from the bootloader subdirectory to the base
directory of the project. Copy all other files to the mcc_generated_files
subdirectory. Be sure to specify the target processor as PIC18F27K40, set the
optimization level to minimize space, then build the project.

The .hex file needed by the MultiMod application project can be found
in the dist/default/production subdirectory.
