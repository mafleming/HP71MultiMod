MultiModII.X

These source files are suitable for the PIC18F2-Q10 family of processors. The
low power requirements of the Q10 make it suitable for a front port module
implementation. The bootloader and serial port monitor code has been removed.
ROM images and code would be updated using a PICKit-3 or better programmer.
